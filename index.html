    <!-- O R I G I N A L   W R I T E   U P
    For tic-tac-toe, for efficiency, the entire game board and its
    core elements could be loaded statically on initial load. UI 
    elements could be as well. I don't see any reason to generate 
    content dynamically as of this writeup.  The following elements 
    would need to be created:
    - Four (4) lines representing the grid separations (this could 
    just be a grid with borders on certain sides?)
    - Xs and Os placed into those grid sections
    - Player and CPU scores
    - Button for restarting the session and scores -->
