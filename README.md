# tic-tac-toe


## The Assignment
Tic-Tac-Toe is one of the simplest games to explain and play, and ironically, also one of the easiest to mathematically predict. This assignment requires the creation of a two-human-player game of tic-tac-toe.

### Creative License
I took liberties with some of the assignmet instructions.

Elements such as scoring were optional, and most of the CSS choices were completely superfluous, but I did choose to skip on assigned item: player names.  After four days of working on the project, I couldn't be bothered to actually create little form inputs for them, even though I knew how.

## What I Did
I made the original mistake of trying to create an AI to play against. If this interests you, you can check out the add-bot-player branch of this repo to explore what I came up with.

I initially struggled to conceptualize the functions in this project, as the "Factory Pattern" of functions is new to me.  Eventually, thanks to members of [The Odin Project Discord](https://discord.gg theodinproject) I was able to overcome my misunderstandings and get functions to, well, function.

After that, building out the logic was pretty straightforward.  Most of my time sunk into this project was spent figuring out ideal ways to encapsulate and modularize code so as to be efficient and secure Despite my best efforts, I'm willing to bet some of my code is still not as encapsulated as it could be. Feel free to message me on Discord if you think of a refactor that would truly revolutionize my code.
